Project 2 focused on Discrete events, this project simulated a vending machine that accepted quarters, nickels and dimes. For
every $1.00 inserted the vending machine would output a coffee. You can ask for change as well which will return the amount
change to you based on what is available in the machine, throwing an exception otherwise.
