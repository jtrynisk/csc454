Project 3 continued on discrete events, this project implements a network of atomic models. The network had two XOR models,
and a memory model. This network would perform the function y(n+1) = y(n) XOR (x1(n) XOR x2(n)). The framework for the network
and models is written with generics. It also included writing the vending machine from project 2 in C++.
