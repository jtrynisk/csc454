Project 1 was a game with characters that could move between rooms. There were NPC's and Animals they preferred opposite
states of the room. Rooms could be dirty, half-dirty, or clean. The PC could move around the rooms, and tell animals to move or
clean and dirty the room, the PC could also tell animals to clean or dirty the room. This would effect the overall
respect of the PC.
